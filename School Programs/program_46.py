    You are provided the above two functions, your job now is to take
    user input and validate it. In other words, take integer input from
    the user, and make sure that it is a perfect square. If it's not,
    you need to keep asking the user for a perfect square until they
    enter one.
    Hint, you should use a while loop to validate input!
    Another hint, you are provided the function (is_square) which will
    check to see if a positive integer is a perfect square or not!
